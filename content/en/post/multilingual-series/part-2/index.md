In the [first part]({{< ref "part-1" >}}) of this Hugo’s Multilingual series, we covered how to manage our content translations and use those in our templates.
  
But what about translating strings for our project or our theme?

In this second part, we’ll see how Hugo, using its familiar data structure and configuration file, allows us to localize strings in any number of languages with minimum hassle.

<!--more-->

## Localizing our strings
When translating strings, Hugo uses a management system in the like of php’s `.po` files. 
Each language’s strings are stored in a file named after its language’s code and dropped in a `i18n/` directory. 

They can either live at the root of our project or at the root of a theme.

- `i18n/en.yaml` ✅
- `themes/academic/i18n/en.yaml` ✅

Following our three languages from part one, they would look like the following

```yaml
# i18n/en.yaml 🇬🇧
- id: hello
  translation: "Hello"
- id: how_are_you
  translation: "How are you doing?"
```

```yaml
# i18n/fr.yaml 🇫🇷
- id: hello
  translation: "Bonjour"
- id: how_are_you
  translation: "Comment allez-vous ?"
```

```yaml
# i18n/es.yaml 🇪🇸
- id: hello
  translation: "Hola"
- id: how_are_you
  translation: "¿Como estas?"
```


As seen above all we need for each translated phrase is a `key` string and  a `translation` string.

Afterwards from our templates, Hugo’s [`i18n`](https://gohugo.io/functions/i18n/#readout) function does the localization job.

1. It will try and match the the passed key to the corresponding localized phrase and return it on success.
2. If the key does not exist in the current language's `i18n` file, it will look for it in the default language.
3. If not found in the default language, an empty string is returned.

```go-html-template
<header>
	{{ i18n "hello" }}
	<hr>
	{{ i18n "how_are_you" }}
</header>
```


```html
<!-- /es/index.html 🇪🇸 -->
<header>
	Hola
	<hr>
	¿Como estas?
</header>
```

```html
<!-- /fr/index.html 🇫🇷 -->
<header>
	Bonjour
	<hr>
	Comment allez-vous ?
</header>
```

{{% notice %}}
The `i18n` function is aliased as `T`. So if typing `i18n` seems like a <del>mouthfull</del> keyboardfull, feel free to use the following syntax:
 `{{ T "how_are_you" }}`.
{{% /notice %}}

## Pluralizing our strings
Strings won’t always refer to lonely entities. Sometimes they qualify one thing, sometimes more. So how can we make sure this phrase is always faithfully localized, single or plural? 

Hugo does offer a [`pluralize`](https://gohugo.io/functions/pluralize/#readout) template function but it only works in english. 

Luckily, Hugo’s string localization handles other languages perfectly.

{{% notice %}}
To better illustrate the feature, we’ll be using examples involving... rodents 🐭! Don’t mind them as they make very interesting plurals in all three languages!
{{% /notice %}}

How does it work? Well, as it turns out the value for your `translation` key can also be a map of plural tags!


```yaml
# i18n/en.yaml 🇬🇧
- id: mouse
  translation:  
    one: Mouse
	other: Mice
```

Great, now our phrase has a singular version (`one`) and a default version (`other`) which will be our little friend's plural.

Let’s fill in our other data files:

```yaml
# i18n/es.yaml 🇪🇸
- id: mouse
  translation:  
    one: Ratón
	other: Ratones
```

```yaml
# i18n/fr.yaml 🇫🇷
- id: mouse
  translation:  
    other: Souris
```

Because the French word `Souris` is the same in both its singular and plural form, we just need that `other` plural tag.

The template function `i18n` takes a second parameter, an `int`, which will let Hugo know how many items your string is referring to and pluralize it if needed. 


```go-html-template
{{ range .Pages }}
	<h3>{{ $.Title }}</h3>
	{{ with .Params.mice }}
		{{ i18n "this_story_has" }} {{ . }} {{ i18n "mouse" . }}.
	{{ end }}
	<hr>
{{ end }}
```

Considering we have 2 stories, the first one with 24 Mice and the second one with only 1 Mouse, this is how our HTML would compile:

```html
<h3>Cinderella</h3>
This story has 24 Mice.
<hr>
<h3>Fantasia</h3>
This story has 1 Mouse.
<hr>
```

### Including the number in the translation

You can even include the number right in your translated string using `.Count` and get and merge those two strings into one: (Mind the double quotes)

```html
- id: story_mice
  translation:
    other: "This story has {{ .Count }} Mice"
    one: This story has only one Mouse
```

From now on, as the number of mice will be included in the `i18n` returned output, we can update ou code with this one localized string:

```diff
- {{ i18n "this_story_has" }} {{ . }} {{ i18n "mouse" . }}
+ {{ i18n "story_mice" . }}
```

Our new compiled HTML would now output:

```html
<h3>Cinderella</h3>
This story has 24 Mice.
<hr>
<h3>Fantasia</h3>
This story has only one Mouse.
<hr>
```

{{% notice type="warning" %}}
Already thinking about "_This story has no Mouse_" when the count is `0`? 
As [explained further down](#hugo-filesystem-and-string-localization), it's a no go 🙅‍♂️.
{{% /notice %}}
### Including a context in the translation

Instead of an `int` you can also pass a context as a second argument to `i18n`. Again this could save us from splitting an interpolating sentence into serveral localized strings even when we need more than `.Count`.

```yaml
# i18n/en.yaml
- id: intro
  translation:  "This is the story of {{ .Params.lead }}{{ with .Params.location }} which takes place in {{ . }}{{ end }}"
```

```yaml
# i18n/en.yaml
- id: intro
  translation:  "Voici l'histoire de {{ .Params.lead }}{{ with .Params.location }} qui se déroule à {{ . }}{{ end }}"
```

It works like a `partial` context.

```go-html-template
<h3>{{ .Title }}</h3>
<div class="intro">{{ i18n "intro" . }}</div>
```

```html
<h3>The Great Mouse Detective</h3>
<div class="intro">This is the story of Basil which takes place in London</div>
```

When passing a `context` as `i18n` argument, you should bear in mind the following:

1. `i18n` won’t be able to evaluate the argument as a number (because it’s not), so forget pluralizing this string with `one` and `other`.
2. If calling this string in more than one place, you should make sure to always pass the same context or use `with` as we did above otherwise you'll risk ending up with an ugly `can't evaluate field` error.

### Hugo filesystem and string localization
Remember that our `i18n` files are part of the global Hugo filesystem. Every `en.yaml` files present in Hugo’s file hierarchy will be merged.
So if one of the translation in the theme we are using does not suit us, all we'd have to do is create another `i18n/en.yaml` at the root of our project (or a preeminent theme component) and include only that one translation in it.

```html
# i18n/en.yaml
- id: mouse
  translation:  
	one: Rodent
	other: Rodents
```

That's it! For the other languages, Hugo will default to `themes/miceandmen/i18n/`'s _Souris_ and _Ratones_ 🐁.

### A final world on strings and plural tags

Like French, Spanish and many others, the English langauge only offers two forms of pluralization, it’s either __single__ or __plural__. 

So quite logically, in Hugo, while treating a string in english, the only available plural tags are `one` and `other`.

And the right tag will be determined by this simple test:

__if__ `i18` integer argument __==__ `1`  👉  `one`
__else__ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  👉  `other`

That's it for most european languages!

Now some languages like Russian have a special pluralization for `few` and another for `many`, Arabic has one for `zero` and one for `two`[^1].

As I'm sure we can all guess what kind of number will match the `zero` and `two` plural tags, guessing how many items it takes to reach a `few` or `many` in Russian is a bit of a head-scratcher.

Luckily we can leave it to Hugo and [Nick Snyder](https://github.com/nicksnyder)’s [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) to solve that puzzle for us.

{{% notice %}}
Here are the supported plural tags across every languages:
`zero` `one` `two` `few` `many` `other`
{{% /notice %}}

Again, this does not mean you can use those in English. 

If the current language is English, your "Mice count" is 0, and you set the `zero` plural tag to `This story has no Mouse`, you’ll still end up with the `other` string, `This story has 0 Mice`.

For the `zero` string to show, the current language would have to be Arabic or any other one which supports the `zero` plural tag.

## Conclusion 🏁

Localizing strings in Hugo is as easy as writing a data file for each or some of your project's languages.

In this series we found out that be it for editors to translate page content or for coders to localize templates, Hugo offers a very simple, scalable and risk free Multilingual solution! 

Now if you have built complex Multilingual projects with languages more exotic than the one used in this series, or if you think this piece misses some crucial information, or if you were able to fact-check the number of mice in Cinderella[^2], please drop a note in the comments!
