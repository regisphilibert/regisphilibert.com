title: Japanese Localization
---

Hi there! 

Here is the site in Japanese: [staging.regisphilibert.com/ja]({{< ref path="/" lang="ja" >}})

As mentioned in my email, the general tone is formal, using the masu form. I like the coloquial tone of my website, but I was not sure I could let go of the masu form. Let me know what you think.
I already did my best in translating what I could (or thought I could) but of course, if you spot any poor translations I did not mention in this note, feel free to let me now.

The following notes are precise points in the website where I need your input/help, again you may find other areas where I also need it 🤷‍♂️.

## Navigation
Not sure about this one. It supposed to be clear this leads to the contact page.

## Projects

Please click on the links to read the project's full desc.

### [ja/project/boralex-france]({{< ref path="/project/boralex-france" lang="ja" >}})

I was not able to convey the idea that “they wanted to move away from WordPress”. Also the sentence in bold means the website loads very fast, not sure if 静的 is the right adjective for that.

### [ja/project/weekly-paper]({{< ref path="/project/weekly-paper" lang="ja" >}})
No too sure about the first sentence… (a lot of の in there)

### [ja/project/375mtl/]({{< ref path="375mtl" lang="ja" >}})

This one may be a bit too formal 👔

## About: [ja/about]({{< ref path="about" lang="ja" >}})
This page the biggest challenge.

The original intent of the phrase below is the idea that not only do I live in Montreal, I also work occasionally FOR the city of montreal. I resolved to splitting this into two different sentences due to my poor japanese. But maybe you can somehow find a way to better match the english sentence 🙏

I build websites from but also for Montréal 🇨🇦.|🇫🇷・私はカナダに住むフランス人です・🇨🇦 <br> モントレアルにウェブサイトを作っている。

Do you think the following sentence is translatable? For now I was just able convey my love for emojis 😊

I’m big on emojis and it’s not a phase mom! 🤷🏻|絵文字が大好き

Still in the about page, you will find one paragraph left in english. Here I'm afraid I cannot do my share, and will let you translate it all, if you got the time.

There is also a footnote which I was not able to translate. It’s just a funny remark so no pressure on this one. Not sure if LinkedIn is this big in Japan anyway...

## Contact: [ja/contact]({{< ref path="contact" lang="ja" >}})

The title of the page, お問い合わせ... I'm not sure this is how you guys title "contact" pages in Japan. Let me know what you think.

I think the placholder for the form are fine, but the warnings I don't know, you can see them live on the site by hitting the submit button with blank inputs. The second tries to be funny in english, not sure this is doable in japanese but if yes, please go ahead.
