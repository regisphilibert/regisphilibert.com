I build websites from but also [**for**](/project_tags/mtl/) Montréal 🇨🇦.

My name is mentioned in the <span class="desktop-inline">sidebar (twice)</span><span class="mobile-inline tablet-inline">header (biggly)</span>, I've been in the business since 2010 and I have this [old thing](https://2011.regisphilibert.com/) to prove it.

I'm big on emojis and it's not a phase mom! 🤷🏻

I am __front end__ first and foremost, the view is what I love best. That being said, I do __back end__ as well and as far as backend is concerned, my first love and expertise is [WordPress](/project_tags/wordpress) but my new love, which I can't stop writing [about](/tags/hugo), is [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/)[^1].

My most outstanding works are listed [here](/).

I'm on <span class="black-color font-semibold">[GitHub](https://github.com/regisphilibert)</span>, <span class="twitter-color font-semibold">[🐦Twitter](https://twitter.com/regisphilibert)</span> and <span class="black-color font-semibold">[LinkedIn🚾](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regisphilibert)</span>[^2].

Oh and there's a skill grid down [there ⏬](#skill-grid).

[^2]: I would never, in my wildest dream, imply that LinkedIn is toilet, it's just the [emoji](https://emojipedia.org/water-closet/) closer to their logo.

[^1]: Yes this website is built with Hugo.
